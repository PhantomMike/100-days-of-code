### Day 2: January 10, 2017

**Today's Progress**: Ran through additional 20 challenges on FCC.  Learned about more basic HTML and CSS functionality such as forms, different input types, using ids, and padding/border/margin.  Also checked in resultant "cat photo app" html to git hub that has been the code I have been building up over the past few days.

**Thoughts:** It's been fun to work on this stuff and also to make a standalone html file that I checked in and pushed to githum, and that can also be loaded in the browser.

### Day 1: January 9, 2017

**Today's Progress**: Ran through first 20 challenges on FCC, HTML5 and CSS.  Also wrote some Java code to verify school final questions.

**Thoughts:** Some of the html in the tool did not render properly.  Had to mess around with it and used some workarounds.  Similar problem in IE though.

**Link to work:** Nothing in github yet!

### Day 0: January 8, 2017

**Today's Progress**: Learned about 100  Days of Code, set up github, gitter, and ran through 'Getting Started' section on freeCodeCamp.

##### (delete me or comment me out)

**Today's Progress**: Fixed CSS, worked on canvas functionality for the app.

**Thoughts**: I really struggled with CSS, but, overall, I feel like I am slowly getting better at it. Canvas is still new for me, but I managed to figure out some basic functionality.

### Day 1: June 27, Monday

**Today's Progress**: I've gone through many exercises on FreeCodeCamp.

**Thoughts** I've recently started coding, and it's a great feeling when I finally solve an algorithm challenge after a lot of attempts and hours spent.
