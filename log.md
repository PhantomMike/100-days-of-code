**Today's Progress**: Learned about 100  Days of Code, set up github, gitter, and ran through 'Getting Started' section on freeCodeCamp.

**Thoughts:** Took a lot longer than expected just to get everything set up, still learning. Looking forward to learning html/css and beyond!

**Link to work:** Nothing yet!

### Day 1: January 9, 2017

**Today's Progress**: Ran through first 20 challenges on FCC, HTML5 and CSS.  Also wrote some Java code to verify school final questions.

**Thoughts:** Some of the html in the tool did not render properly.  Had to mess around with it and used some workarounds.  Similar problem in IE though.

##### (delete me or comment me out)

**Today's Progress**: Fixed CSS, worked on canvas functionality for the app.

**Thoughts**: I really struggled with CSS, but, overall, I feel like I am slowly getting better at it. Canvas is still new for me, but I managed to figure out some basic functionality.
