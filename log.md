# 100 Days Of Code - PhantomMike Log

### Day 4: January 12, 2017

**Today's Progress**: Took a break from FCC to work on Java code for FTC Robotics. Tested student's line following code, ran some simulations, and provided a few suggested tweaks.

**Thoughts:** Looking forward to the FTC Robotics student's tournament this weekend!

### Day 3: January 11, 2017

**Today's Progress**: Finished up last 15 or so challenges in FCC HTML5 & CSS, then started looking at the Responsive Deign section with Bootsrap. Learned more about padding/border/margin and dug into the relative priority of specifying style and it can be overidden. Looks like the last style listed in the CSS class wins, and ID trumps class, and style declared inline in the element itself is highest priority. Also learned about different ways to specify colors including #000000 (hex), #000 (abbreviated hex), or rgb(0, 0, 0)(rgb).  Started the Bootstrap stuff but will dig into that tomorrow.

**Thoughts:** Lots of ways to specify colors and padding/border/margin, the latter attributes and their relationship still isn't crystal clear.  Was good to learn how html5 prioritizes conflicting styles specified in various ways.

### Day 2: January 10, 2017

**Today's Progress**: Ran through additional 20 challenges on FCC.  Learned about more basic HTML and CSS functionality such as forms, different input types, using ids, and padding/border/margin.  Also checked in resultant "cat photo app" html to git hub that has been the code I have been building up over the past few days.

**Thoughts:** It's been fun to work on this stuff and also to make a standalone html file that I checked in and pushed to githum, and that can also be loaded in the browser.

### Day 1: January 9, 2017

**Today's Progress**: Ran through first 20 challenges on FCC, HTML5 and CSS.  Also wrote some Java code to verify school final questions.

**Thoughts:** Some of the html in the tool did not render properly.  Had to mess around with it and used some workarounds.  Similar problem in IE though.

**Link to work:** Nothing in github yet!

### Day 0: January 8, 2017

**Today's Progress**: Learned about 100  Days of Code, set up github, gitter, and ran through 'Getting Started' section on freeCodeCamp.

**Thoughts:** Took a lot longer than expected just to get everything set up, still learning. Looking forward to learning html/css and beyond!

**Link to work:** Nothing yet!

##### (delete me or comment me out)

**Today's Progress**: Fixed CSS, worked on canvas functionality for the app.

**Thoughts**: I really struggled with CSS, but, overall, I feel like I am slowly getting better at it. Canvas is still new for me, but I managed to figure out some basic functionality.

**Link(s) to work**: [Calculator App](http://www.example.com)


### Day 1: June 27, Monday

**Today's Progress**: I've gone through many exercises on FreeCodeCamp.

**Thoughts** I've recently started coding, and it's a great feeling when I finally solve an algorithm challenge after a lot of attempts and hours spent.
