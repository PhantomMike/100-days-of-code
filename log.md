### Day 44: March 28, 2017

**Today's Progress:** Yikes, been out for 2 weeks! Worked on Java gridworld code for sample apps in preparation for AP CS exam polymorphism review.

**Thoughts:** Was out of town for most of a week, and super busy otherwise with volunteer and family stuff. Starting to get back into the coding groove.

### Day 43: March 12, 2017

**Today's Progress:** Built a web page/pen that will store notes and summaries from my html/css/jscript studies.

**Thoughts:** This was pretty fun but took a long time. I took my portfolio page project from fcc and used it as the framework for a new site that will track notes I have as I take various html/css/jscript courses.  Most of what is in there now is just summary pages from each section of the codeacademy tutorial I took, but I can build from that.

### Day 42: March 11, 2017

**Today's Progress:** Continuing FCC break, learned tables and finished codecademy "Learn HTML & CSS: Part I" tutorial!

**Thoughts:** Tables were pretty straightforward.  I noticed the summary at the end of the tables lesson contained a very nice page of the entire lesson including the motivation and the elements involved and how they are used.  This was very compact and could be used as a reference.  I think it might be cool to assemble some notes for this entire course that has basically the summary page from each lesson.  That would make for a nice cheat sheet for html coding moving forward!  Perhaps make a web site that does this easily?

### Day 41: March 9, 2017

**Today's Progress:** Continuing FCC break to evaluate codecademy HTML & CSS tutorial: css positioning and images.

**Thoughts:** A bit more confusing with all the different ways to place things, and position, and sometimes a requirement for dependent tags in order for certain things to work. Doesn't seem to memorable, will definitely need to reference this material in the future.

### Day 40: March 8, 2017

**Today's Progress:** Continuing FCC break to evaluate codecademy HTML & CSS tutorial: borders and box model.

**Thoughts:** Straightforward stuff.

### Day 39: March 5, 2017

**Today's Progress:** Continuing FCC break to evaluate codecademy HTML & CSS tutorial: ids, classes, and divs.

**Thoughts:** Straightforward stuff.

### Day 38: March 1, 2017

**Today's Progress:** Continuing FCC break to evaluate codecademy HTML & CSS tutorial, colors and fonts.

**Thoughts:** Learned a lot about colors and fonts in these two sections.  Very instructive lessons with good examples to code in to see how the output is effected by the changes.

### Day 36 & 37: February 26 & 27, 2017

**Today's Progress:** Took FCC break to evaluate codecademy HTML & CSS tutorial.

**Thoughts:** It's pretty interesting and quite well done so far. Tends to have more explanations and detail than FCC, possibly better for beginners. Doesn't seem to have more significant challenges though like FCC does, at least not yet.  Will continue to explore this, seems like a good tool for students up at school.

### Day 34 & 35: February 24 & 25, 2017

**Today's Progress:** Finished all FCC Basic Algorithm Scripting challenges.

**Thoughts:** Learned some good stuff, String.replace with regular expressions, String.split to create an array out of the String with specified delimiiter, String.join to build a string from an array with a specified delimiter.  Array.map to iterate and create a new array, Array.reduce to iterate and return a value, Array.filter uses to create a new array with elements removed, and basic Array methods like reverse, sort, and concat.

### Day 33: February 23, 2017

**Today's Progress:** Did first three FCC Basic Algorithm Scripting challenges, palindromes are next.

**Thoughts:** Need to figure out how replacing works with regular expressions.

### Day 31 & 32: February 21 & 22, 2017

**Today's Progress:** Finished FCC Object Oriented and Functional Programming sections!

**Thoughts:** Starting to get more comfortable with embedding function declarations inline. Looks like these lessons are essentially showing how to use a variety of builtin methods associated with arrays/objects.  Need more practice with all of this stuff, looks like teh challenges coming up will help with that.  Also learned about contructors, private properties, and methods in objects.

### Day 30: February 20, 2017

**Today's Progress:** Finished FCC JavaScript! Learned about loops, regular expressions, & random.

**Thoughts:** If you want to access a property in an object, and the property name is stored in a variable, then you need to access using square brackets [] after verifying the property exists with hasOwnProperty. Access via the dot operator does not work.

### Day 29: February 19, 2017

**Today's Progress:** FCC learning JavaScript, learned about objects. Fascinating! 

**Thoughts:** Interesting how objects present themselves as an array different types of elements, with key value pairs separated by a colon used to access/store.  So, you access fields in the object by referencing it's property.  Can be accessed either via dot notation or bracket notation, the latter is required if the property name has a space in it.  Can also add items to object, delete items, and check if a field exists in the object.

### Day 28: February 18, 2017

**Today's Progress:** Back to Java sample for students' project, wrote Java sample and slides to demonstrate difference between Comparable and Comparator interfaces. 

**Thoughts:** Will get this reviewed and tweak it for next week of school, want to think more about if it is clear.

### Day 27: February 17, 2017

**Today's Progress:** FCC and learning Javascript challenges completed: conditionals, expressions, booleans, switch. 

**Thoughts:** The only thing odd was the "strict equality" of === which means both the type and value need to be the same, normal equality == will convert types and then compare.

### Day 26: February 16, 2017

**Today's Progress:** FCC and learning Javascript, functions and scope today. 

**Thoughts:** The lack of types is still strange. Also learned if you declare a variable without the var it becomes automatically global in scope!

### Day 25: February 15, 2017

**Today's Progress:** Back to FCC and learning Javascript, did all the array challenges! 

**Thoughts:** Arrays are interesting, type doesn't matter.  You can push/pop an element on/off the end of an array and you can shift/unshift an element to/off the front of an array.  Syntax is same and access is via familiar square brackets. 

### Day 23 & 24: February 12 & 13, 2017

**Today's Progress:** Updated Java biological virus sample app, accomodating more feedback. 

**Thoughts:** Met to discuss sample app with colleagues, made additional changes to documentation and implementation. New quality projects for students definitely take a lot of work! :-)

### Day 22: February 10, 2017

**Today's Progress:** Updated Java biological virus sample app, accomodating feedback. 

**Thoughts:** Met to discuss sample app with colleagues and made agreed upon changes to documentation and implementation.

### Day 21: February 8, 2017

**Today's Progress:** Tweaked Java virus sample app and went back to FCC! Did about 20 of the Javascript lessons. 

**Thoughts:** The Javascript lessons are pretty basic right now. Variables, math, string literals, bracket notation, concatenation, that kind of stuff. Next lessons deal with arrays.

### Day 20: February 7, 2017

**Today's Progress:** Continued to put aside FCC to finish sample implementation of Java app for my student's next project involving biological viruses. 

**Thoughts:** It is basically done now. May make a few tweaks based on feedback but I'll go back to FCC and Javascript tomorrow.

### Day 19: February 6, 2017

**Today's Progress:** Continued to put aside FCC to work on sample implementation of Java app for my student's next project involving biological viruses. 

**Thoughts:** Have a lot implemented and running, may be enough so I can switch back to FCC javascript tomorrow. We will see, depending on feedback.

### Day 18: February 4, 2017

**Today's Progress:** Continued to put aside FCC to work on sample implementation of Java app for my student's next project that parses files containing biological virus information and does interesting things with them.

**Thoughts:** Done with first phase, sending in for feedback from fellow teachers and refinement.  Will also write the entire sample app as the overall project is in 3 stages and fairly complex, so want to make sure we are on target with the complexity and size of the work requested and time allowed.

### Day 17: February 2, 2017

**Today's Progress:** Putting aside FCC to work on sample implementation of Java app for my student's next project that parses files containing biological virus information and does interesting things with them.

**Thoughts:** Should take one more day and then will get back to FCC and java script.

### Day 16: January 30, 2017

**Today's Progress:** Started up java script section of FCC. Cranked through about the first 20 lessons.

**Thoughts:** Pretty basic so far, looking forward to learning more. There is a lot in this section!

### Day 15: January 29, 2017

**Today's Progress:** Finished up the Portfolio page! Implemented the thumbnails, gave hover effect, had them link to the appropriate code pen page. Also used fontawesome to add neat glyphs to my contact buttons for codepen, facebook, linkedin.

**Thoughts:** Nice to work on the Portfolio page to finish the functionality and add some nice touches. Ready to move on, next FCC section is all about java script.

**Line to work:** http://codepen.io/PhantomMike/full/RKgMwN/

### Day 14: January 28, 2017

**Today's Progress:** Made more tweaks to the page, instead of finishing up the portfolio thumbnails. Learned more about bootstrap grid layout and button tweaks, how to jump to different parts of a page.

**Thoughts:** Enjoying learing about bootstrap and what it can do for me so I will continue to tweak before finishing up.

### Day 13: January 27, 2017

**Today's Progress:** Made good progress on Portfolio Page on codepen. Structure is all there, just needs assets to finish it up.

**Thoughts:** I'm pretty happy with where this is heading. I've used a bit of jscript for classes to make that a little more concise but I'm not sure if that is the 'best' way to do things.  Functionality was not to hard to get done, did some web searches for bootstrap helpers.  Should be able to finish it up tomorrow.

### Day 12: January 25, 2017

**Today's Progress:** Started FCC Porfolio Page on codepen. Needs more planning, only very rough skeleton so far.

**Thoughts:** Need to decide how fancy I want this to be. I'm going to focus on using the grid/columns in boostrap and going from there, so this will primarily be a bootstrap learning exercise.

### Day 11: January 24, 2017

**Today's Progress:** Worked on a small Java project I'll be teaching tomorrow, and finished up my FCC Tribute Page on codepen!

**Thoughts:** I'm pretty happy with the tribute page. I tried to keep it pretty simple and focus on using the skills and tools I learned, rather than trying to get too fancy and trying to do a bunch of stuff I haven't really learned yet.  More time for that down the road...

**Link to work:** http://codepen.io/PhantomMike/full/RKgMwN/

### Day 10: January 23, 2017

**Today's Progress:** Missed a few days, but I have a first take at my FCC Tribute Page!

**Thoughts:** I needed to poke around in my FCC work to help me get started and remember some of the bootstrap syntax. I also did some web searches to help me customize the look of the page a bit more and tune some spacing.  Overall I'm pretty happy with it, will finish it up tomorrow, submit for feedback, and move forward.

**Link to work:** http://codepen.io/PhantomMike/full/RKgMwN/

### Day 9: January 20, 2017

**Today's Progress:** Created CodePen account and ran through tutorial, ready to start FCC Tribute Page tomorrow!

**Thoughts:** Looking forward to using this new tool and digging into the first meaty challenge/project.

### Day 8: January 19, 2017

**Today's Progress:** Finished FCC jQuery lessons, published sample html on github. Learn about CodePen tomorrow!

**Thoughts:** Enjoyed working through it, jQuery has a lot of capability. Looking forward to CodePen and starting my first project tomorrow.

**Link to work:** https://github.com/PhantomMike/100-days-of-code/blob/master/jquery2.html

### Day 7: January 18, 2017

**Today's Progress:** Worked on the first half of FCC jQuery lessons, published sample html on github.

**Thoughts:** Fun stuff, reminds me of some experience with "dynamic html" many years ago...

**Link to work:** https://github.com/PhantomMike/100-days-of-code/blob/master/jquery1.html

### Day 6: January 17, 2017
**Today's Progress:** Back to FCC coding again. Finished up the FCC Bootstrap section as well as the following 'Gear Up For Success' section. Ready to jump into the jQuery topic tomorrow!

**Thoughts:** Finishing up the last Bootstrap section, especially the preparing for jQuery section, gave me more confidence I was retaining the information from Bootstrap. I'm interested in seeing how much of this information I continue to retain as I move forward.

### Day 5: January 16, 2017
**Today's Progress**:  Took several days off to focus on FTC Robotics and recover. ;-) Back working on FCC, did the first 18 challenges using Bootstrap and put the resultant html file up on github.

**Thoughts:** There is beginning to be a lot more to remember, lots of classes and CSS packages to use!

**Link to work:** https://github.com/PhantomMike/100-days-of-code/blob/master/CatPhotoAppWithBootstrap.html

### Day 4: January 12, 2017

**Today's Progress**: Took a break from FCC to work on Java code for FTC Robotics. Tested student's line following code, ran some simulations, and provided a few suggested tweaks.

**Thoughts:** Looking forward to the FTC Robotics student's tournament this weekend!

### Day 3: January 11, 2017

**Today's Progress**: Finished up last 15 or so challenges in FCC HTML5 & CSS, then started looking at the Responsive Deign section with Bootsrap. Learned more about padding/border/margin and dug into the relative priority of specifying style and it can be overidden. Looks like the last style listed in the CSS class wins, and ID trumps class, and style declared inline in the element itself is highest priority. Also learned about different ways to specify colors including #000000 (hex), #000 (abbreviated hex), or rgb(0, 0, 0)(rgb).  Started the Bootstrap stuff but will dig into that tomorrow.

**Thoughts:** Lots of ways to specify colors and padding/border/margin, the latter attributes and their relationship still isn't crystal clear.  Was good to learn how html5 prioritizes conflicting styles specified in various ways.

### Day 2: January 10, 2017

**Today's Progress**: Ran through additional 20 challenges on FCC.  Learned about more basic HTML and CSS functionality such as forms, different input types, using ids, and padding/border/margin.  Also checked in resultant "cat photo app" html to git hub that has been the code I have been building up over the past few days.

**Thoughts:** It's been fun to work on this stuff and also to make a standalone html file that I checked in and pushed to githum, and that can also be loaded in the browser.

**Link to work:** https://github.com/PhantomMike/100-days-of-code/blob/master/cat%20photo%20app.html

### Day 1: January 9, 2017

**Today's Progress**: Ran through first 20 challenges on FCC, HTML5 and CSS.  Also wrote some Java code to verify school final questions.

**Thoughts:** Some of the html in the tool did not render properly.  Had to mess around with it and used some workarounds.  Similar problem in IE though.

**Link to work:** Nothing in github yet!

### Day 0: January 8, 2017

**Today's Progress**: Learned about 100  Days of Code, set up github, gitter, and ran through 'Getting Started' section on freeCodeCamp.

**Thoughts:** Took a lot longer than expected just to get everything set up, still learning. Looking forward to learning html/css and beyond!

**Link to work:** Nothing yet!


<!--
### Day 0: February 30, 2016 (Example 2)
##### (delete me or comment me out)

**Today's Progress**: Fixed CSS, worked on canvas functionality for the app.

**Thoughts**: I really struggled with CSS, but, overall, I feel like I am slowly getting better at it. Canvas is still new for me, but I managed to figure out some basic functionality.

**Link(s) to work**: [Calculator App](http://www.example.com)


### Day 1: June 27, Monday

**Today's Progress**: I've gone through many exercises on FreeCodeCamp.

**Thoughts** I've recently started coding, and it's a great feeling when I finally solve an algorithm challenge after a lot of attempts and hours spent.
